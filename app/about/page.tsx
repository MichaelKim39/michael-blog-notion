            I{`'`}m a web and mobile developer currently working at Theodo UK. I
            like bouldering, photography, reading, eating, oversize clothing and
            playing the guitar. My spirit animal is Snorlax.

            My mission in life is to solve social media. In 2020, I co-founded a
            startup called 0Regrets that aimed to help people live fulfilling
            lives filled with intention.

            I{`'`}m focussing on upskilling technically now, but I{`'`}ve never
            stopped working towards my goal of developing a social media that is
            productive and energising!
